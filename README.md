# Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The analysis obtained from the code shows the summary of school data for a local government area. This includes the total number of schools, total number of students, total budget, average maths and reading scores, and the percentage of students who passed maths, reading, and both. This information can be used to evaluate the performance of schools in the local government area and identify areas for improvement. **It should also be noted that using averages of averages does not lead to accurate results but it is assumed the results obtained from the analysis is accurate to draw the following conclusions.**

# Conclutions and/or comparisons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# School Spending
One interesting comparison that can be made using the data from the local government area's school district is the relationship between school spending and student performance. 
The results show that there is a weak, but statistically significant, negative relationship between per student budget and average math and reading scores. This means that schools with higher per student budgets tend to have lower average math and reading scores compared to schools with lower per student budgets.
It is important to note that this relationship is weak and may not hold true in all cases. Additionally, there are likely many other factors that influence student performance, such as the quality of teaching and the socio-economic background of the students. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make sweeping generalizations about the relationship between school spending and student performance based on this analysis.
Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence student performance and how best to allocate resources to improve student outcomes. However, this initial analysis suggests that simply increasing per student budgets may not necessarily lead to improved student performance.

# School Sizes
According to the data, there is a positive correlation between school size and overall passing rate. In other words, smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates than larger schools. This trend is demonstrated by the fact that the smallest schools in the data (those with less than 1000 students) have the highest average overall passing rate, while the largest schools (those with 2000-5000 students) have the lowest average overall passing rate.
However, it is important to note that this is only a general trend and may not hold true for all schools. Once again other factors such as the quality of education, the resources available to students, and the demographics of the student body can all affect a school's overall passing rate and may contribute to deviations from the general trend. Additionally, the sample size of schools included in the data may not be representative of all schools, which could affect the accuracy of the results.
To fully understand the relationship between school size and overall passing rate, further analysis and data would be needed. This could include a larger and more diverse sample of schools, as well as additional factors that could influence overall passing rates. Additionally, it would be important to consider other measures of educational performance, such as standardized test scores and graduation rates, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
Overall, the data suggests that school size is a significant factor in determining overall passing rates. Smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates, but further study is needed to confirm and expand upon this finding.

# School Type
The comparison of the average maths and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing maths and reading exams, between government and independent schools shows that independent schools generally outperform government schools. The average maths score for independent schools is 71.4, while the average for government schools is 69.8. Similarly, the average reading score for independent schools is 70.7, while the average for government schools is 69.7.
Additionally, the percentage of students passing maths exams is higher in independent schools at 89.2%, compared to 84.5% in government schools. The same trend is seen in the percentage of students passing reading exams, with 86.2% of independent school students passing, compared to 83.6% of government school students.
These findings suggest that independent schools may have a higher quality of education and better resources for student learning. However, it is important to note that this data does not take into account other potential factors, such as socio-economic status of the students or school funding, that could also impact student performance. Again, further research would be needed to fully understand the reasons for the differences in performance between government and independent schools.
